# Similarity-Ensemble-Approach
Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) is widely known for finding set similarities with a statistical approach to predict chemical similarities and side effects in drug-related studies. They help in studies related to screening of large databases containing structures of available (or potentially available) chemicals. This is based on the studies of similar property principle of Johnson and Maggiora, which states: Similar compounds have similar properties . In this project, we developed a simulation of finding the similarity amongst sets of molecular topology. We propose a statistical method which creates bins that provide ranks for their similarity scores, i.e the closest sets are mapped using the Minimum Spanning Tree approach. The proposed approach includes a Java implementation that decreases the runtime from the previous Python implementation. We have run the simulations for different sample sizes from 100 to 1000. There is a significant increase in the runtime, in comparison with the existing python implementation.
